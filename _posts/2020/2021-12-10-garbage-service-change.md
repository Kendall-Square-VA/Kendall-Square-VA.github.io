Kendall Square Residents and Owners,

This week we are changing the trash and recycle service provider for the community.   Here is what you need to know and what we need all residents to do on Friday:

1.  Last trash collection by American will be on Tuesday, 8 December (usual collection).

2. After Tuesday, there will be NO FURTHER TRASH COLLECTION NOR RECYCLE PICK-UP THE REMAINDER OF THIS WEEK!

3.  ACTION ITEM:  Instead of placing recycle and trash out on Thursday evening for Friday collection, PLEASE PLACE YOUR COMPLETELY EMPTY TRASH AND RECYCLE CONTAINERS CURBSIDE ON **FRIDAY EVENING, 10 DECEMBER** FOR SATURDAY RETRIEVAL BY AMERICAN.

4.  Also on Saturday, Patriot, our new service provider, will be dropping off their trash and recycle containers to each residence.  Please see the attached flyer for description of their services and slightly adjusted weekly pick-up schedule, beginning next week.

5. Please forward any questions you may have to <a href="mailto:home@kendallsquarefairfax.com">the board</a>, and we will answer as best we can.



For information your new service, including the new schedule and instructions, please read [the following PDF](/static/files/2021-kendall-square-garbage-service-change.pdf).
