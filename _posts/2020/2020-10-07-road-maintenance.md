# Road Maintenance

On Wednesday, October 21st through Thursday, October 22nd, the Kendall Square HOA will be performing road repairs.  
This will include filling cracks, painting curbs, seal coating the pavement, and painting the parking lines.  This 
will occur on the following schedule:

* On Wednesday, October 21st, the eastern half of the neighborhood (closest to Blake Lane) will be completed.  
Simultaneously, the eastern half of the Beech Grove Drive road will also be blocked, making Beech Grove Drive a 
single lane road.

* On Thursday, October 22nd, on the western half of the neighborhood (furthest from Blake Lane) will be completed.  
Simultaneously, the western half of the Beech Grove Drive road will also be blocked, making Beech Grove Drive a 
single lane road.

Please make sure that you have moved your cars away from these work areas during these days and prepare that if 
your house is on one of these sides of the neighborhood, they may be inaccessible during the work.  It is 
suggested that you utilize your garage when not using your vehicle.  If you do need to use your vehicle, it is 
suggested to use the other side of the neighborhood’s visitor parking, street parking outside of the neighborhood, 
or other forms of public parking. **If there are vehicles in the visitors parking area when work begins, the vehicle 
will be towed.**

During this time, as your house may be inaccessible to deliveries as well, so it is suggested that you redirect 
deliveries to USPS, UPS, or FedEx for pickup, use Amazon Locker Delivery, or manage your deliveries in some other 
manner to avoid those particular days in the neighborhood.

Sincerely,

Kendall Square Homeowner’s Association
